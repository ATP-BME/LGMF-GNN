## I. Usage:
The main contribution of our work is the proposed LG-GNN architecture, which enables crosstalk between local brain regions and the global population, and allows identification biomarkers.

The data used in our work are from [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and [ABIDE](http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/). Please follow the relevant regulations to download from the websites.

Using the `main.py` to train and test the model on your own dataset.
The proposed network **LG-GNN** is defined in the `layer.py`.  It can be easily edited and embed in your own code.

## II. Requirements:
* torch_geometric
* torch
* scipy
* visdom
* numpy
* os
## III. Citationï¼š
If our paper or code is helpful to you, please cite our paper. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
