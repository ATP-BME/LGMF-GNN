# Graph Neural Network for Brain Network Analysis
 A preliminary implementation of BrainGNN. The example presented here is on the public resting-state fMRI ABIDE for the convenience of development. This dataset was different from the ones used in our publication, which are cleaner task-fMRI. Still seeking solutions improve representation learning on the noisy data.


## Usage
### Setup
**pip**

See the `requirements.txt` for environment configuration. 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**PYG**

To install pyg library, [please refer to the document](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)

### Dataset 
**ABIDE**

We treat each fMRI as a brain graph. How to download and construct the graphs?
```
python 01-fetch_data.py
python 02-process_data.py
```

### How to run classification?
Training and testing are integrated in file `main.py`. To run
```
python 03-main.py 
```
